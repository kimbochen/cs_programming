# CS Programming
> Projects of programming classes

1. Final Project I: A shooting game written in C++ using Allegro. The original files are gone.
All I could find was the code that was similar to the alpha version.
2. Final Project II: A mystery-solving game written in C++ using Allegro complying to the object-oriented programming paradigm. The mystery was based on the TV series _Sherlock_, and was designed on my own from scratch.
3. Mini Project 1: A sytax tree parser written in C++. I learned the instruction set architecture by writing the program.
4. Mini Project 2: A game written in C++ that follows the object-oriented programming paradigm. I learned to read OOP code by working on the project.

> The two classes were the first two computer science class I've ever taken.
> It's a pity that I haven't learned about version control,
> but I'm glad to see I have made so much progress last year.
